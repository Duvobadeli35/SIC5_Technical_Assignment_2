  <h1><strong>Dataset AI4I 2020 Predictive Machine Maintenance</strong></h1>
</div>
 The dataset consists of 10 000 data points stored as rows with 14 features in columns

1. UDI: unique identifier ranging from 1 to 10000
2. product ID: consisting of a letter L, M, or H for low (50% of all products), medium (30%) and high (20%) as product quality variants and a variant-specific serial number
3. air temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process later normalized to a standard deviation of 2 K around 300 K
4. process temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process normalized to a standard deviation of 1 K, added to the air temperature plus 10 K.
5. rotational speed [rpm]: calculated from a power of 2860 W, overlaid with a normally distributed noise
6. torque [Nm]: torque values are normally distributed around 40 Nm with a Ïƒ = 10 Nm and no negative values. 
7. tool wear [min]: The quality variants H/M/L add 5/3/2 minutes of tool wear to the used tool in the process. 
8. a 'machine failure' label that indicates, whether the machine has failed in this particular datapoint for any of the following failure modes are true.
